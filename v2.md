# Serverless sux

> Slide: 1st one, can stay the same with the huge vercel bill

### Notes
serverless cons:
- little utility without scale
- very dangerous at scale
- you're locked in to whatever they let you use
- if you want to use something else you have to host it yourself anyway (e.g. latest postgress)
- they are behind (you have to wait for them to adopt latest & gratest tools before you can use them)
- what if vercel shuts down? You're vendor locked
- You can get the same iteration speed on bare-metal

### Talking
Okay you want fast iteration, i get it but you can get fast iteration by hosting it yourself. Tools like vercel have little utility when you don't have scale, but when you do have scale they become very dangerous (don't get put into debt). You also can't use the latest & greatest technology because you have to wait for it to be adopted by the serverless provider of your choice which they might not do at all, and then you have to either find another serverless provider that does offer it and manage both or host it yourself so you're renting a server anyway.

The fast iteration is not limited to serverless, you can easily achieve the same thing with the setup we'll be showing you

(demo)

# We want bare-metal

> Slide: some generic server photo, not much to show here

### Notes

bare-metal pros:
- No limits on what you can use (If you wanted to you could compile the latest version of software from the master branch and use that)
- It's all open source / open standard, you're not vendor locked.
- Cheap, predictable pricing
- You can run it on a machine you own (I have everything hosted locally and use a rented server with public IP as proxy).
- vercel doesn't have clickhouse
- there is clickhouse cloud

### Talking

By hosting everything ourselves you can use anything you would like, e.g. at Dialo we use a database called clickhouse which lets us scan through terabytes of logs in a few seconds. It's not magic obviously and has it's tradeoffs but it's extremely good at doing what we want from it. Vercel doesn't let you use clickhouse out of the box so we would have to set it up a different way, there is e.g. clickhouse cloud, let's take a look

--------------
# Another 3rd party dependency

> Slide: clickhouse cloud pricing and calculator side by side showing it costs 162$/month for 1TB uncompressed 24h/day

### Notes
- you get $300 credits, what about after that?
- pricing per compute hour is unpredictable

### Talking

Okay we get $300 free credits, nice. What about after that though? $25 per 1TB, that's not that bad i guess i probably won't have 1tb of data. What about that other metric? Compute per hour, that's not very specific, i don't know what computations it might do in the background. How long does indexing take? Compression and decompression might get a little crazy too.

(Compare to hetzner)

Same spec, 1TB storage, 2 x vCPU -> 60 euro, 1/3rd the price. And remember with hetzner you can run anything you want on the same server. On cloud that's just the price of storage.

# too many tools to learn so ppl give up

> Slide: different names of tools in a giant mess on screen

### Notes
bare-metal cons:
- lots of tools
- the tools don't work (e.g. brew fucks up dependencies)
- ordering from ikea, every screw requires a different screwdriver

### Talking

Okay so you can probably see that it's cheaper to run your own. But serverless exists for a reason, i mean WHO would want to configure their own server, i mean you have to SSH in for every change, set up the firewall, routing, probably some reverse proxy if you have multiple apps, and each one probably needs a database, so you install it with brew or apt or pacman but there is a dependency conflict and it's not for the right version of your distro and it breaks so you fix it, and you don't want to use the same database instance so no other app has access to other apps data so you want containers so you use docker so you google the correct flags because some port needs to be exposed probably, and you want some more order in this chaos so you use docker compose or docker swarm but what are they and which one to use and how to use it and it's just a mess

It's like ordering furtniture from IKEA but for every screw you need a different screwdriver

# were just going to need 2 tools

> Slide: nix and k8s logos cover the giant mess from previous slide showing we only need these 2

### Notes
N/A

### Talking
It doesn't have to be like that though. All of that can be achieved with just 2 tools. Kubernetes... And Nix

# explain k8s

TODO

### Talking
TODO

# open k3s requirements

### Notes
- It's the same story again, too much stuff, rant a bit

### Talking
So let's see we want to install k3s, which is a simplified kubernetes distribution with some set up done out of the box.

(show requirements and rant a bit)

Okay that sucks too, it's the same problem as before...

--------------
# nix fixes this

### Notes
- it helps with that
- show one liner services.k3s.enable = true;
- say that it isolates packages, fixing the dependency issues with homberew
- it's json with functions
- nixos is based on this architecture

### Talking
Now here is where the other tool you saw earlier comes in, by that i mean Nix. NixOS is a linux distribution like ubuntu or arch, except it's nothing like those 2. On ubuntu or arch to install k3s you would either run the shell script they tell you to run on their website but i mean god know what's in there it would probably break half way through and you would end up with a broken half installed k3s setup and nothing short of machine reset would completely fix it. Or you would get it for your specific distro with their package manager like apt on ubuntu or pacman on arch or homebrew on mac. But i wouldn't trust that either i mean who here has never had an issue installing some package and it just worked exactly how it was supposed to every time? Sometimes its a wrong version of a dependency (actually almost always) wrong version of OS, some remnants of an old installation of the same app remained and break the new install, a lot of things can go wrong.

But nix doesn't do it like brew or pacman or apt or any other package manager available, Nix builds each package with only what it requires and makes every dependency explicit so you always get all of the dependencies and the right versions of them, you never lack anything there is never conflicting versions because they are all isolated from eachother. Each packages sees only what it needs to function. What does that mean in practice? Nix is stable, very stable. If it worked once it will keep working.

Nix is also declarative, that's a very cool thing for a linux distro because you can do crazy stuff like this: 
```nix
{
  services.k3s.enable = true;
}
```
This is how you set up k3s on NixOS. You add 1 line to your config and nix will handle the rest.

This also means if you ever want to switch servers, all you have to do is copy over the config files and you'll have the exact same setup as before.

That's the complete oposite of serverless because it's impossible to vendor lock you, if they try anything shady you'll just leave and all it'll cost you is 5 minutes and 1 ssh copy command.
